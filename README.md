# MySQL Database Operations Readme

This repository contains Python scripts for performing various operations on a MySQL database using the mysql-connector-python library. Below is a brief overview of the functionalities and scripts included in this repository:

## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `mysql-connector-python`
  
You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

## Usage

### Connecting to MySQL Database
- The script `create_server_connection` establishes a connection to the MySQL database server.
- It also includes functions for creating a new database and connecting to an existing database.

### Creating Database and Tables
- The script `create_database` creates a new database if it does not already exist.
- It includes SQL queries for creating tables within the database. However, it handles errors gracefully if the tables already exist.

### Inserting Data
- The script `data_orders` inserts sample data into the `orders` table.

### Retrieving Data
- The script `read_query` executes SQL SELECT queries and fetches the results.
- Various SELECT queries are demonstrated, including retrieving all records, specific columns, filtering by date, and ordering results.

### Modifying Data
- The script includes examples of updating and deleting records from the `orders` table.

### Viewing Results
- After executing queries, the results are printed in the console and displayed as pandas DataFrame for better visualization.

## Note
- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions and access rights to execute database operations.
- Modify the connection parameters (`host_name`, `user_name`, `user_password`, `db_name`) as per your MySQL server configuration.

Feel free to explore and modify the scripts according to your requirements!
